# Overview
This program, Tic Tac Toe, is exactly what it sounds like. A simple game of tic tac toe that plays in a terminal window. 

I wrote this game of tic tac toe in order to get my feet wet with the Rust language. I come from a history of mainly
Python and Javascript, so working in rust felt unlike anything I've worked with before. There were some challenges, but
I'm starting to understand what's going on and will continue to do more research outside the scope of this simple project.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my text editor.

This program is written with Rust
